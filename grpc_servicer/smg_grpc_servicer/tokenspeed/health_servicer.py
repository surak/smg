"""Standard ``grpc.health.v1.Health`` servicer for the TokenSpeed backend.

Mirrors ``smg_grpc_servicer.sglang.health_servicer.SGLangHealthServicer`` —
same service-name semantics, same lifecycle (NOT_SERVING → SERVING → NOT_SERVING),
same ``check/watch`` contract — but sources liveness signals from a TokenSpeed
:class:`AsyncLLM` instead of an SGLang ``GrpcRequestManager``.

The Rust router uses this health check to auto-detect the backend runtime.
TokenSpeed ships its own ``tokenspeed.grpc.scheduler.TokenSpeedScheduler``
service identity (see ``proto/tokenspeed_scheduler.proto``) so the probe
distinguishes TokenSpeed workers from real SGLang workers regardless of any
wire-level message-type sharing between the two backends.
